=== 0.2.0

This release fixes the outstanding bugs that required you to set http_get_method,
url_name and division.

You should no longer need to set division explicitly.

If you are currently setting url_name to deploy to a context-root that doesn't
match the application variable's value, you will need to set context_root instead.
If you are only setting url_name to the same as application, you no longer need
to set it.

If you are setting http_get_method in order to pass http_proxy or https_proxy
environment variables to wget, then set proxy instead to a URL (for example to
'http://proxy.intra.bt.com:8080/').  Other uses of http_get_method are no
longer supported.

Detailed changes:

* Update documentation to say that 'packaging' must be set if no POM file is provided
* Default :division to 'public'
* Replace :http_get_method with :proxy and change how wget command is built
* Remote (rarely used) support for scm_verbose option in Nexus SCM module
* Rename 'url_name' variable to 'context_root'
* Fix defaulting of 'url_name' to value of 'application' variable
