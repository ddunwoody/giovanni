=== 0.2.1

tomcat_shutdown_port now defaults to tomcat_http_port+1000.  This means that it
now defaults to 9080 instead of 8005, and, more importantly, it no longer needs
to be explicitly specified if you're following the DSO convention of shutdown
port being 1000 higher than the HTTP port.

The tomcat_* variables are now defined in settings.rb, instead of being defaulted
inline in the erb templates.  This continues the trend of all default values being
explictly listed in settings.rb.

=== 0.2.0

This release fixes the outstanding bugs that required you to set http_get_method,
url_name and division.

You should no longer need to set division explicitly.

If you are currently setting url_name to deploy to a context-root that doesn't
match the application variable's value, you will need to set context_root instead.
If you are only setting url_name to the same as application, you no longer need
to set it.

If you are setting http_get_method in order to pass http_proxy or https_proxy
environment variables to wget, then set proxy instead to a URL (for example to
'http://proxy.intra.bt.com:8080/').  Other uses of http_get_method are no
longer supported.

Detailed changes:

* Update documentation to say that 'packaging' must be set if no POM file is provided
* Default :division to 'public'
* Replace :http_get_method with :proxy and change how wget command is built
* Remote (rarely used) support for scm_verbose option in Nexus SCM module
* Rename 'url_name' variable to 'context_root'
* Fix defaulting of 'url_name' to value of 'application' variable
